            <h3>Let's Start a Cult (2024)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Let's Start a Cult is a darkly humorous exploration of human psychology, with a comedic look at the charisma and manipulation that go into creating a following. The film balances satire with thought-provoking moments, poking fun at cult dynamics while also showing the emotional toll on those involved. Stavros Halkias is hilarious in this film where he gets to take center stage. </p>

            <h3>Alien: Romulus (2024)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Romulus captures the claustrophobic horror that fans love about the original Alien franchise, blending intense action with a relentless sense of dread. The new characters bring fresh dynamics, and the tension is palpable throughout. The visuals and sound design add to the atmospheric terror, making each encounter with the xenomorph unforgettable. While it doesn’t reinvent the series, Romulus is a solid addition that respects the roots of Alien while delivering enough thrills and new concepts to add new weight to the Franchise</p>

            <h3>Dune: Part Two (2024)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Dune: Part Two, while visually impressive, didn’t resonate with me as much as I expected. The film’s slow pacing and heavy exposition made it a bit of a slog to get through. While the world-building is detailed, it sometimes feels overwhelming and detracts from the narrative momentum. The performances are solid, but the characters feel distant, making it hard to fully engage with their journeys. The film’s grand scale is undeniable, I Was told the film was gonna be epic but it left me feeling like I watched a three hour colgone commercial by the time the credits rolled.</p>

            <h3>Oppenheimer (2023)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Oppenheimer is a powerful and deeply affecting film that explores the moral complexities of one of history's most pivotal figures. Christopher Nolan's direction is masterful, weaving together a non-linear narrative that immerses you in the psychological turmoil of J. Robert Oppenheimer as he grapples with the consequences of his work on the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy delivers a career-defining performance, capturing the brilliance and torment of the "father of the atomic bomb." The film's cinematography, score, and pacing all contribute to an intense and thought-provoking experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It’s a haunting exploration of science, ethics, and the human condition.</p>

            <h3>Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Killers of the Flower Moon is a meticulously crafted and harrowing account of a dark chapter in American history. Martin Scorsese masterfully tells the story of the Osage murders, blending crime drama with a poignant exploration of systemic racism and greed. Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro deliver powerful performances, but it’s Lily Gladstone who truly shines, bringing a quiet strength and depth to her role. The film’s pacing is deliberate, allowing the horror of the events to unfold with a sense of inevitability that is both chilling and heartbreaking. The cinematography captures the stark beauty of the setting while underscoring the brutality of the story. It's a haunting and essential film that demands reflection on the past and its echoes in the present.</p>

            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> One of the best superhero films of all time. Heath Ledger’s performance as the Joker is legendary.</p>

            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> A monumental achievement in open-world design. The attention to detail is staggering, and the story is a slow-burn masterpiece. Arthur Morgan's journey is complex and emotional, making this one of the best games of the last decade.</p>

            <h3>Alien: Isolation (2014)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Alien: Isolation is a masterclass in tension and atmospheric horror. The game captures the essence of the original Alien film, making you feel helpless as you are hunted by a near-invincible xenomorph. The AI is incredibly smart, and every encounter is a terrifying game of cat-and-mouse. The sound design and visuals perfectly complement the horror, creating an immersive experience. Though the pacing may feel slow at times, it only adds to the dread, making each moment of calm before the storm even more nerve-wracking. A must-play for survival horror fans.</p>

            <h3>NCAA Football 25</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> NCAA Football 25 is a nostalgic return to college football, with updated graphics and refined mechanics. The gameplay feels smooth, and the attention to detail in stadiums and team rosters brings authenticity to each game. Dynasty mode remains a highlight, allowing you to build a program from the ground up. However, some features feel recycled from previous entries, and while it’s a solid football game, it doesn’t quite push boundaries like its NFL counterparts. Still, for fans of college football, it's a welcome and long-awaited return.</p>

            <h3>Longlegs</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Longlegs is a suspenseful and eerie film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie excels in building tension, with a slow-burn approach that gradually unveils its dark and twisted narrative. The performances are strong, particularly from Maika Monroe, who brings a compelling mix of vulnerability and intensity to the role. The cinematography and sound design work hand in hand to create an unsettling atmosphere, making every scene feel charged with suspense. While the film may not be for everyone due to its deliberate pacing and violent themes, it’s a must-watch for fans of psychological thrillers. The ending leaves a lasting impact, tying together the film's themes in a way that’s both disturbing and thought-provoking.</p>

            <h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> The Batman is a dark, brooding take on the iconic character that feels fresh and grounded. Robert Pattinson brings a new intensity to the role, portraying a younger, more troubled Bruce Wayne who is still figuring out his place in Gotham. The film’s noir-inspired aesthetic, combined with its gritty, atmospheric visuals, sets it apart from previous Batman adaptations. The storyline is engaging, with a focus on detective work that harkens back to Batman’s roots as the “World’s Greatest Detective.” The supporting cast, particularly Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman and Paul Dano as the Riddler, delivers standout performances. While the film’s runtime is lengthy, it uses every minute to build tension and develop its complex characters. It’s a bold and compelling entry in the Batman saga that will leave fans eager for more.</p>

            <h3>Tim Dillon: This is your Country (2024)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Tim Dillon's This Is Your Country is a hilarious unscripted comedy where he chats with everyday Americans about outrageous topics like cryptocurrency and OnlyFans. With his sharp wit and fearless humor, Dillon keeps the live audience laughing throughout. The candid conversations and absurd topics make this a standout comedy special for fans of his bold style.</p>

            <h3>MLB The Show 24</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> MLB The Show 24 continues to deliver a solid baseball simulation experience with a few new features that enhance the gameplay. The visuals and animations are as crisp as ever, capturing the nuances of the sport in impressive detail. The updated Road to the Show mode offers deeper customization options and a more immersive career journey, which is a definite highlight. However, some of the game modes feel a bit repetitive, and while the gameplay mechanics are polished, they don't stray far from previous entries in the series. Overall, it's a great game for baseball fans, but it might not offer enough innovation to wow those who have played recent iterations.</p>

            <h3>Dead Island 2</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Video Game</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Dead Island 2 brings some fun zombie-slaying action but ultimately falls short of being a standout title. The game offers a decent variety of weapons and the melee combat is satisfying at times, with some gory finishers that fans of the genre will appreciate. However, the game’s repetitive mission structure and lack of depth in both the story and character development hold it back. The world, while vibrant, feels a bit empty and lacks the sense of danger that should be present in a zombie apocalypse. It's enjoyable in short bursts but doesn’t have the staying power to keep you hooked for the long haul.</p>

            <h3>Goodfellas (1990)</h3>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Goodfellas is an iconic mob movie that masterfully blends style and substance. Martin Scorsese's direction is flawless, with dynamic camera work and a killer soundtrack that perfectly capture the rise and fall of Henry Hill. The performances, especially from Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, are unforgettable. The film’s pacing is relentless, pulling you into the seductive and dangerous world of organized crime. It’s a gripping, gritty tale that remains a landmark in the gangster genre.</p>

            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Movie</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 8.5/10</p>
            <p><strong>My Thoughts:</strong> Civil War by A24 is a gripping and thought-provoking film that showcases A24's trademark blend of atmospheric storytelling and complex characters. The narrative explores the psychological and societal impacts of conflict, with a focus on the human cost of war. The performances are powerful, with the lead delivering a haunting portrayal of a journalist grappling with moral ambiguity.
